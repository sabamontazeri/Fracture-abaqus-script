This project is written for **Calculation of stress intensity factors (SIFs) for various loads**
**In this porject**:
1. Forces subjected to the drill is derived by the formulas mentioned in .docx document using the essential tables.
2. Forces acting on column is derived by statical analysis.
3. The written abaqus script calculates stress intensity factors. An overview of the model is shown below.
